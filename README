This is hcidump port into Android.

This is build on Ubuntu 11.04 64 bit. If you are using 32 bit operating system , drop me a message to explain configuration required for that.

Simply use ndk-build command on the application root and binary executable will be generated into libs/armeabi named hcidump , or you can directly download it from there in the source code.

Push hcidump into your android mobile using:

adb -d push hcidump /data/local

Go to shell of your android mobile using :

adb -d shell

and cd to /data/local

get superuser permission using: su

then run:
./hcidump
